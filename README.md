# AskMe
AskMe is a short project where you talk to an entity and can easily create pattern of discussion. This idea came during an info/art project at university.

You can create discussion just by using : {text:"",y:1,n:2,i:3} where 'y', 'n' and 'i' are link to answer and the next questions. 
The technical goal is to use array as much as we can and to exploit the potential and the limit of TS Arrays.

The artistic goal is brought the user to think about AI. Because, later, when the project will be fully developped. The main scenario will discuss about you and your identity and progressivly the entity will ask itself life questions. This will bring few questions like : 

- Where are we in AI dev ?
- Can we imagine an AI able to understand what is a human ?
- If so, can it understand it univers ? the dimension its living in ?

Those are only few questions you could ask yourself about AI ! but there is a lot more !


This programm also have another goal ! 
By using list it should be easy to modify and easy to share so i'm believing (when the first artistic part is created) to share an easy-editing version, maybe with a UI to create your own scenarios !
